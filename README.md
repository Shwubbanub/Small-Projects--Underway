# Small-Projects--Underway
This is a small collection of small projects some mates and I am currently working on, the versions included here are incomplete (duh), but should be up to date with our local files.

Currently included:

    - "LRLRLRGO", a low-res rythm game that duets the D-pad and keyboard. PRIORITY-HIGH
    
    - "OnceAponATime", a smallish text-based adventure/RPG that I plan to actually finish this time, featuring bespoke inputting and cool colours. PRIORITY-MEDIUM,HIGH
